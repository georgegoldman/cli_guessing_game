# I implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit

# How to run the application
## cargo update
## cargo build
